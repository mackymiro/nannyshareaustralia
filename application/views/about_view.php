            <p class="p-lg">Nanny Share Australia was founded by Franciska Framke. She utilised her extensive background in working with children to address the growing need of parents to obtain quality care at an affordable price. Having worked as a nanny for 20 years, 3 of which as a shared nanny, she decided to create an online platform to assist parents and nannies in organising successful nanny share arrangements.</p>

              "Caring for children has been my life-long commitment. As a qualified preschool teacher, I've had years of experience teaching in centre-based care before choosing to become a career nanny. Although Australia boasts some amazing day care centres, its my personal and professional opinion that hiring a nanny tops them all. Being a highly experienced nanny comes with a costly price tag for parents. This is where I sincerely hope that my website can help. By splitting the costs with another family, the luxury of hiring a nanny can now become a reality!".
