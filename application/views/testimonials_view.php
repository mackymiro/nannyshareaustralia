                <p>My nanny has doubled up with another family to do nanny share. My daughter gets the same quality care at almost half the cost, and cheaper than the days she attends day care. The 3year old boy from the shared family has become her best friend! </p>

                <p>We use a shared nanny one day a week for our son. He receives professional care from a qualified nanny at a discounted price. It's our son's favourite day of the week.  I wouldn't even consider any other child care options.</p>

                <p>I have spent the last 16months working as a 'mummy nanny' with my 24mth old daughter. As a qualified child care educator of 14 years, Im finding my new role just as rewarding, if not more, as my previous positions. Both children receive daily social interactions, and individualised care in a home environment from an experienced nanny at a reduced cost. I have built a trusting relationship with the child and the family of whom I care for.
