They are exploring their environments to develop knowledge and life skills, yet remain so innocent and vulnerable.<span style="color:#0000FF"> Its an enormous year of learning and growing,</span> when their little personalities develop and explode. How these personalities develop can be largely influenced by the caregivers in their world...whether it be the mum, dad, grandma, nanny or anyone involved in their upbringing. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:14px">They are very quick to learn the limitations implemented by different carers. <span style="color:#ff0099">It all about &#39;cause and effect&#39;</span>. Therefore, how the adults respond, encourage and role model behaviours will have a massive impact on their level of TERRIBLE! </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#0000CD"><strong>1. Set limits.</strong></span></span><span style="font-size:14px"> By setting limits, the toddler knows what they can and can&#39;t do, so by giving them clear boundaries you can reduce the amount of &#39;NOs. Let them know what actions are appropriate rather than constantly reprimanding them for those which are not. &#39; Their little brains are like sponges soaking up data. Even if your toddler isn&#39;t saying many words yet, their receptive language skills are better than you may think.Try to reinforce these limits with positivity rather than negativity. For example, &quot;you must hold my hand near the road to stay safe&quot; over &quot;don&#39;t let go of my hand or you&#39;ll be run over&quot;.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#0000CD"><strong>2. Provide a safe environment </strong></span></span><span style="font-size:14px">. Prevention is always better than cure. Less accidents, means less tears and less upset for everyone involved. Keep dangerous objects out of harms reach. Provide areas that promote independence without sacrificing their safety. Let them have little bins and falls to learn about their own capabilities and provide praise for any newly mastered skills. Expose them to stairs they can master, store dangerous products out of reach and give them more than one safe place to explore.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#0000CD"><strong>3.Stay consistent.</strong></span></span><span style="font-size:14px"> Give in once, and you have given in a thousand times! &quot;But its easier just to give in sometimes&quot;. This is the biggest of them all. Yes, there are times when we adults are tired and can&#39;t be bothered with &#39;the fight&#39;, but unfortunately short term gain from giving in, will result in long term pain of arguments. Don&#39;t make a threat that you&#39;re not prepared to carry through, or next time this same threat will be useless. If you threatened to leave the park if unsavoury behaviour continues, and it does persist...leave the park! Next time, your toddler will know you mean it. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="color:#0000CD"><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>4.Role model appropriate behaviour. </strong></span></span><span style="font-size:14px">You may as well throw the saying out the door &quot;do as I say and not as I do&quot;, if you&#39;re hoping for a terrific two. Children look up to their carers and want to be just like them. Don&#39;t leave your dirty washing laying all over the bedroom floor and then expect the toddler to pack up their toys. They believe everything you say and have faith in everything you do. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong><span style="color:#0000CD">5. Know their developmental capabilities</span></strong></span><span style="font-size:14px">. Temper tantrums are a normal aspect of development for toddlers, but if they are not handled correctly, they will be longer and louder than anyone cares to imagine. 2 year old tantrums are mostly an expression of their emotions. They usually don&#39;t have the expressive language skills to logically express what they are feeling. Try to ignore tantrums as best you can. Make sure the child is in a safe area where you can see them and let them cry it out...... but don&#39;t give attention and don&#39;t give in! There is an abundance of information on the web related to child development. </span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style="color:#0000CD"><span style="font-size:18px">6. Give praise for positive behaviour over focusing on the negative.</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:14px"> But do this carefully, as overuse can be like water off a ducks back. Praise the behaviour where its earnt and don&#39;t put too much attention about the less favourable actions. Chance are, the negative behaviour is attention seeking, and if they don&#39;t get any attention for it, they quickly realise it doesn&#39;t work. 6 Know the triggers. Take a mental and/or written note of particularly traumatic situations to gather any patterns which can indicate triggers. Some examples of triggers can be tiredness, hunger, frustration, reaction to certain foods or just plain attention seeking. A good routine can usually rule out tiredness and hunger, a healthy diet can limit food preservative triggers and providing developmentally appropriate activities covers a lot of frustration. As far as attention seeking behaviour, remember to give no attention to negative behaviour. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong><span style="color:#0000CD">7.Time out still remains a debatable form of discipline.</span></strong></span><span style="font-size:14px"> If you choose to use it, make sure the time-out area is free from activity, especially activity pleasurable to the child. Explain to the child why they have been put there and leave them for a couple of minutes to think about it. If they have impacted negatively on another child, encourage them to say &quot;sorry&quot;. Toddlers are egocentric and they won&#39;t mean sorry even if they say it, but it installs good manners for the future. If the child bluntly refuses to apologise, don&#39;t make a huge deal out of it. Simply apologise on their behalf, tell them that your disappointed and leave the situation. </span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#0000CD">8.Provide choice.</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:14px"> Young children like to make decisions to feel in control. Offer them choices that are realistic and don&#39;t leave them too open or you may not agree with their choice. For example, at dinner time, don&#39;t ask them &quot;what do you want for dinner?&quot; but instead ask &quot;would you like pasta or chicken for dinner?&quot; </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="color:#0000CD"><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>9. Remain calm.</strong></span></span><span style="font-size:14px"> Yelling won&#39;t help yelling. If a child is constantly yelled at, it becomes their norm. Remain calm, get down to their eye level and express your disappointment in a level voice. </span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#0000CD">10. Don&#39;t be scared of upsetting your child.</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:14px"> If you implement all the above, chances are, your terrible two year old will be mostly terrific. If your child becomes upset from discipline, don&#39;t worry, its healthy for them to have a good cry and they won&#39;t love you any less.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="color:#ff0099">EVERY CHILD IS UNIQUE...BUT THESE PRINCIPALS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN EVERY SINGLE CHILD I HAVE CARED FOR IN THE PAST 15</span> <span style="color:#ff0099">YEARS.</span> And remember, just because its known as the terrible twos...it can start at 12months and will continue for as long as you allow it. </span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style="font-size:14px">Good luck and enjoy them.........&nbsp;<img alt="laugh" src="http://www.nannyshareaustralia.com.au/assets/js/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/teeth_smile.png" style="height:23px; width:23px" title="laugh" />&nbsp;Nanny Share Australia&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n', 'taking-the-terrible-out-of-the-twos', '11/09/2014'),

My mum must return to work soon.\n\n\nOn her first day back at work she was really stressed. She woke me earlier than usual. It was cold and raining outside. She packed a bag for me, then battled  the weather to strap me into the car seat for a new adventure.\n\nFifteen minutes later, we arrived at a huge building that I had not seen before. There was a combination of laughter and tears coming from within. We entered a series of doors and safety procedures. I could see an abundance of toys and many unfamiliar faces. This place could be fun I thought. Then my mum handed me over to a stranger, kissed me softly and waved goodbye.\nWhat was happening? What is this place? Who are these people? Where is someone, or at least something, that''s familiar to me? How long will I have to stay in this strange place?\n\nEight hours later, my mum returned. Thank goodness she is back, I''ve felt quite uneasy all day. I hope she doesn''t need to leave me here again.\n\nThe next day, history repeats itself. We are back in this unfamiliar environment. This time, I knows she''s leaving so I''m upset before she does. I''m at the height of separation anxiety and I''m scared.\n\nFour weeks later, we are still going to this place. My upset begins as we pull up out the front. There are so may different faces for me to recognise. I''m not always greeted by the same carer. Although I have happy moments during the day, I mostly don''t like coming to this strange place. I don''t really like the food they are serving me. I don''t sleep very well in the cot room. Sometimes when I''m upset, no-one is immediately available to comfort me. \n\n There are lots of other children here whom seem to love it, but its just not for me.\n\nMy immune system isn''t coping with the exposure to all these germs. I always getting sick. Mum and dad are constantly arguing over who can stay home and care for me when I''m unwell.\n\nMy mum and dad really want to hire a nanny so I can be cared for at home. This way, I have a familiar face greeting me every day. I can spend a lot of time in my home environment. We don''t have to go out in the rain. I can sleep in my own room. And my nanny can cook pumpkin soup just the way I like it!\n\n"But we can''t afford a nanny", I hear my dad say. And this is where ''nanny share'' came to my rescue. If we share a nanny with a local family, we can split the cost, hence make it affordable.\n\n Now when my mum leaves for work, my nanny comes to my home. I see her 4 days a week so I get to know her well in a short period of time. My nanny loves me very much. I love the fact that I can spend my younger years being cared for at home. We also go on lots of little outings to parks and playgroups. \n\nThe other family involved in our nanny share agreement has a boy named Tom who is around the same age as me.  Sometimes Toms'' mum drops him off at our house for the day. Sometimes my mum takes me to Toms house for the day. I like going to Toms house. Tom has become my best friend. His house is like a second home to me. I love my nanny. I''m so glad my parents discovered  nanny share  and didn''t just brush off the idea of hiring a nanny under the assumption it was unaffordable!\n\nMy mum seems much happier going to work and leaving me in the care of a qualified, experienced nanny. My parents don''t argue about giving up work wen I''m sick because my nanny comes to care for me. I don''t get sick as often anymore. My nanny cooks nutritious meals for me and my parents, and sorts out my washing so my mum doesn''t have to worry about that on the weekends.  When my new sibling arrives, my nanny will care for them too for a little bit extra per hour. \n\nNanny Share..............the affordable option!!', 'i-want-a-nanny', '11/17/2014'),
(3, 'What is nanny share?', 'f3302cdbc10e09d34746e1456311ded4.jpg', '<p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="color:#ff0099"><strong>&quot;The who, what, when, where, why and how of nanny share&quot; WHO is nanny share for?</strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:14px">Nanny share arrangements are perfect for families who wish to have their child cared for by a<span style="color:#0000CD"> nanny in their home environment, without the high price tag </span>. Sole charge nannies can cost as much as $300 per day. <span style="color:#0000CD">Nanny Share arrangements can be as low as $120</span> per day depending on your needs.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#ff0099">Who is nanny sharing for?</span></span><span style="font-size:14px"> Nanny sharing provides ongoing social stimulation for single-child families. <span style="color:#000000">If you want your child to be cared for in a home setting, even when they are unwell, and exposed to their local surroundings, then nanny share is for you. Ideally, families match well with other families who live locally and have a child of similar age </span>and/or routine. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#ff0099">WHAT is nanny share?</span></span><span style="font-size:14px"> Nanny share is exactly what is sounds like. An agreement whereby two families hire one nanny to care for their children together at the same time. In some instances, the nanny will care for the children of both families for an equal amount of time. In other cases, the nanny may have one primary family where the majority of her hours are worked, with the addition of care of a child from another family for a proportion of the week or day. Nanny share should not be confused with a sole charge nanny who splits her time. For example, in 1 day, the nanny works 7-11am for one family, then 11-6 for another...THIS IS NOT NANNY SHARE. If the nanny works 7-6 for family 1, then family 2 drops their child to her from 8-5, the hours of 8-5 are paid at the nanny share rate. The nanny is employed under one umbrella agreement with schedules tailored to meet everyone needs. Sometimes an agreement can include a third family if logistics are managed well. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#ff0099">When should I start looking at nanny share? </span></span><span style="font-size:14px">Babies can be placed in nanny share from as young as 6 weeks. Unlike day care centres, theres no lengthy waiting lists and ongoing stress of non-placement. You can start looking for a family to share with as soon as your baby is born. Its crucial to select the right family match, so the longer you look the more chance you have of finding the best match.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#ff0099">Where does nanny care take place?</span></span> <span style="font-size:14px">There are 3 options for this. Scenario 1, the care takes place at the home of family 1. Scenario 2, the care takes place at the home of family 2. Scenario 3, the care takes place in both homes alternatively each week. This is to be agreed upon by the families and nanny involved before any&nbsp;contract of employment commences.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:20px"><span style="color:#ff0099">Why choose nanny share?</span></span><span style="font-size:14px"> In a nutshell, because its the most cost effective way of having your child cared for by a nanny. Because the care is shared, so to is the cost! Some centres in Sydney charge as much as $170 per day. Quality day care places are becoming increasingly unavailable, whereas nanny share is becoming a growing trend. More and more families are understanding the benefits of nanny share, hence increasing the number of available families to share with. Your childs routine is managed individually by the nanny, they have one primary caregiver to alleviate the stress of separation anxiety, and the nanny will care for your little one when he or she is unwell. No more rushing out the door for day care drop offs, wait for your nanny to come to you! Nanny Share provides flexibility, close adult to child interactions and all round quality care at an affordable price.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#ff0099">How to find a successful nanny share arrangement?</span></span> <span style="font-size:14px">Nanny Share Australia is a new website assisting families all over Australia to find suitable family and/or nanny matches.

Don&#39;t simply trust the opinion of the other family as it may result in future problems. <strong>It is crucial that both families are engaged in the process of choosing the right nanny.</strong> </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px">Ideally, ask the nanny to meet all members of both families in the home or homes, where care will take place. The nanny should arrive at the interview with her CV which includes evidence of past employment, qualifications and certificates, and a list of references. A professional nanny will have a copy for you to keep. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px">Arrange the interview at a time when the children can be present. <strong>Take note of how the nanny interacts with your children</strong> during this time. Sometimes even young babies can be the judge of a misfit. First and foremost, the <strong>nanny must be the perfect fit for both families. </strong>Having worked as a nanny for 15 years myself, its usually evident after one meeting if there is a connection or not. Human nature is excellent at deciding this subconsciously. No amount of experience or qualifications can outweigh a clash in personalities. <strong>There needs to be similar values, ideas and beliefs between the families and the nanny for success to occur.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px">Keep interviewing until you feel 100% confident that you have found the perfect match for everyone involved. Ask yourself and the shared family what is most important for them in a nanny. <span style="color:#B22222">Reference checking cannot be stressed enough.</span> </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px">Ideally, your nanny should provide you with contact details of at least 3 previous positions. Be sure to contact these references, asking everything about the nanny from their sense of humour and punctuality through to their standard of caring for children and any negative habits or behaviour that they displayed. <span style="color:#0000CD">Ask to see evidence of first aid certificates, qualifications and and relevant working with children checks.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#B22222">Below is a list of questions you may like to ask prospective nannies in the interview to help decide if they are the right fit for your family.

Your nanny is hired by you as an employee and therefore is entitled to the same sick leave benefits as child care workers under the state award. The NSW standard sick leave entitlement is 8 days in the first year or pro-rata for the hours worked based on a full-time contract. Be clear to have a procedure in place regarding when the nanny needs to notify you of sickness, e.g. the night before when possible.&nbsp;Most nannies are aware of the inconvenience which can be caused if they are unable to care for your children on the required days. A good nanny will attempt to use minimal sick entitlement days, and return to work even when she is not 100%, on the grounds that they have a quiet day at home with the children and implement extra hygiene precautions to prevent spreading any germs. If your nanny is hired on a casual basis, they may agree to waive sick leave yet request a higher hourly rate of pay. <span style="color:#2F4F4F"><strong>Speaking from experience, the chance of you having to cover sick days for your nanny will be far less than having to stay home from work to care for a sick baby if they attend day care.</strong></span> Many nannies are part of a nanny network and may be able to offer referrals for a replacement nanny if they are unwell.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px">Ideally, one parent from each family can agree to share the cover for sick days. For example, the first time the nanny calls in sick, Mother A stays home from work and cares for the children from both families. On the second occasion the nanny is sick, if it shall happen, Mother B will sacrifice a day at the office and take on care of the the children. This way, if the nanny is sick 4 times in a year, both families will only loose 2 days at work. Try to<span style="color:#FF0000"> be flexible </span>around this. For&nbsp;example, if its family B&#39;s turn to cover the sick day but the mother has an important day packed with back-to-back meetings, perhaps Mother B could offer to cover that day provided Mother A can cover the next 2. Make sure both families are comfortable with any such agreement from the beginning. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#800080">SCENARIO 2: Family A&#39;s son is unwell.</span> Your nanny will still care for you child if he is sick. The decision around this one is <span style="color:#800080">reflective of </span>what <span style="color:#800080">particular illness</span> he has. If its a contagious virus then Family B needs to be notified to decide if they&#39;d prefer to keep their daughter away. The nanny should also be notified if either children have a contagious illness. Most nannies will still care for your children if they are sick, and its always a good question to ask the nanny in the interview if they have had all the typical childhood diseases and if they are immunised. If son A has a cold and is a little snotty, the nanny will be able to monitor their movements closely to assist in preventing cross-contamination. Whatever decision is reached by the families, the nanny is entitled to the full rate of pay for the day. If the nanny chooses to not care for either family for any reason other than he or she being sick themselves, than he or she is not entitled to payment. If either family decides they are not comfortable with care of both children to take place, they are still required to pay their share for the day. Again, exercise some empathy and understanding and remain flexible to keep everyone happy. If the nanny works for family B on Mon,Tues,Weds and Family A on Mondays and Tuesday only, perhaps a swap day to Wednesday could be arranged. Nanny sharing is like a team sport where all the players need to work together to win. SCENARIO 3: The father from family B is unwell and home in bed and its their turn to host care at their house. Nobody wants to stay home in bed from work recovering from sickness with a houseful of children! Be flexible to offer your home for care on these days and if possible give notice to the other family the night before. WHEN DOING REFERENCE CHECKS FOR PROSPECTIVE NANNIES, BE SURE TO ASK PREVIOUS EMPLOYERS HOW OFTEN THE NANNY WAS AWAY DUE TO SICKNESS. This should give a fairly good indication as to whether or not it will be a regular problem in your nanny share arrangement. If your baby is in long day care you will pay for any day they are sick and unable to attend. The centre will most likely call you to collect your child if they believe he or she is too unwell to be in attendance. Most babies are sick more in their first year than any other time during their lives as their tiny bodies try to build immunities to nasty germs. The exposure to germs is far less with a nanny than in a day care setting. Babies can be exposed to germs of up to 72 different children each day depending on the size of the child care centre. In a nanny share arrangement, their tiny bodies only need to cope with germs from the nanny and the other family so the chance of them becoming ill is drastically reduced.

(8, 'The many types of child care explained...', 'e61f5534a0fb57f84099dd7e14c18649.JPG', 'The road to choosing the right type of child care......\n\nThere is a wide range of child care options available in Australia. The first step in deciding which option is best for your family, is understanding exactly what each service provides.\n\n\nLONG DAY CARE: Centre based care operating for a minimum of 8 hours per day, with most opening from 730am-6pm, 50 weeks per year.  Most centres provide meals and a developmental program for the children. Centres must pass Government accreditation standards to be able to offer fee subsidies. Staffing must adhere to DOCS requirements in both numbers and qualification levels. Centres are either community based non-profit,  work/study based, or privately owned. Unfortunately, even with Government standards in place, there is a wide range in quality of services across Australia.  LDC can be an affordable option for families, however, there is no flexibility with lateness, which can incur very expensive late fees. The ratio for adult/child care in NSW is 1:4(children aged 0-24mnths), 1:5(children aged 24-36mnths), 1:11 (children aged 36mnths+).  In the event that your child has a contagious illness, they will be restricted from attending the centre until all symptoms have cleared. Payment is still required if your child does not attend on his or her usual days. Popular centres have long waiting lists and often require a non-refundable deposit to secure a place on their wait list. As an ex-teacher in a privately run 72place LDC, I personally felt that the children under 2 were not receiving the close attention they need due to staff restrictions. Centres often run based on their routines and not on specific individual needs of each and every child in attendance. Be sure to investigate centres thoroughly before accepting placement.\n\nPRESCHOOL:  Centre based care usually operating from 9am-3pm, catering for children aged 3yrs+ and often with the requirement that your child is toilet-trained. They should have a preschool readiness program in place to prepare your child for school.  As with LDC, some preschools are privately owned and others are community based. Most preschools run a 2 or 3 day programme based on the childs age and offer little flexibility around choice of days.  Preschools generally operate to school terms. Food is rarely provided in Preschools and families are required to send their childs food for the day, respecting any food restrictions in place with the centres policies.  Preschools have similar standards to abide by as LDC and also offer subsidised fees based on family income. Preschool care is highly recommended to assist with your childs social skills but has very limited hours for dual working families. \n\n\nFAMILY DAY CARE: Home based care which operates in the carers home. Family Day Care operates under the same National Quality Framework as LDC. Family day carers must possess at minimum, a Cert 111 in children''s services and a current first aid certificate.  FDC co-ordinators monitor the services with regular visits, ensuring the environment meets safety standards. The FDC can assist in finding alternative care in the event that your carer is unwell. The carer can care for up to 5 children under school age, and can also provide before and after school care for children up to the age of 12years. This type of care is recommended if you want siblings cared for together in a home based environment. Deregulation of FDC means theres a huge variation in fees.  Some carers provide food and supplies such as nappies/linen, but many require that you provide these yourself. This type of care can provide flexibility with hours, but is dependant on the actual service you choose. Having worked as a FDC co-ordinator, I  have personally witnessed a range of service from poor through to excellent, so I recommend meticulous research into the particular service you choose. FDC allows families to claim the child care benefit (CCB) based on their income. \n\nSOLE CHARGE NANNY: A nanny is hired by a family as an employee and comes to your home to care for your children whilst you are at work.  This can be on a casual, part-time or full-time basis as agreed upon in the family/nanny contract. This form of child care can be expensive, depending on the experience and qualification levels of your chosen nanny. Children cared for by a nanny are not restricted to a centre environment but rather, enjoy the familiarity of their own home joined with exciting outings in their immediate surroundings.  At present, the government has not recognised nannies as being an approved form a child care so families cannot claim the child care benefit. However,  families can claim the child care rebate (CCR) provided that the nanny is registered with the Family Assistance Office, which is not means tested. A sole charge nanny is responsible for the care of all the children living in your home. Some nannies will provide extra services such as cooking the family meal, folding the washing and running household errands. In the event that your child is unwell, the nanny will still come to your home and provide them with attentive care. Live-in nannies fall under the category of Au pairs. Nannies follow the childs routine as requested by the family, Qualified career nannies can provide excellent advise for families regarding their children.\n\nSHARED NANNY:  A cheaper alternative to sole charge nanny, with comparable benefits. One nanny is hired by 2 families and cares for all of their children together at the same time, either in one of the nominated family homes, or alternating between the 2 homes each week. All costs are split between the 2 families. On average, a shared nanny will charge approximately 30% extra per hour, which is then divided between the two families. For example, a sole charge nanny costing $25p/hour will charge, $32.50p/hour, resulting in each family paying $16.25p/hr for the same level of care. Nanny sharing is a growing trend in Australia as it allows families to enjoy the luxury of having a nanny care for their children at home, without the high price of a sole charge nanny. Ideally, 2 families have similar aged children that follow a similar routine, share similar interests and and live locally to each other. Its suggested that a maximum of 4 children be cared for at once. In the event that 3 families wish to share the nanny, the hourly rate will be slightly higher again, but divided 3 ways to reduce costs even further. For example, the $25p/hr sole charge nanny, cares for 3 babbies from 3 different families, costing the families around $13 each per hour. Nanny sharing can be a very socially satisfying experience and is a win-win for everyone involved provided everything is agreed upon at commencement of care. In some instances, sharing a nanny can be a cheaper alternative to placing your baby in centre based care.  NannyShareAustralia is an online site which matches like-minded families looking for a nanny share arrangement, and will be launched in November 2014!!!\n\nMUMMY NANNY: An experienced nanny, who now has a child of her own, comes to care for your children in your home and brings their own child with them. On average, mummy nannies charge approximately 20% less than their usual rate as a sole charge nanny. With this arrangement, families and the nanny must be clear  about the procedure in place in the event that either your child, or their child is unwell. This can be a very successful arrangement provided the nanny and family have parallel beliefs and ideas in regards to raising their children. \n\nMOTHERS HELPER: Mothers helpers are exactly as it sounds. Usually the mother isn''t working and simply needs an extra pair of hands. Mothers helpers rates are on par with sole charge nannies, but again is dependant on a range of factors. e.g., duties required, hours worked, full-time or part time basis...etc  If your child is clingy or experiencing separation anxiety, a mothers helper may end up more of a hindrance than a help. \n\nAu pair: An au pair is a live-in nanny. Their hourly rate is inexpensive, however boarding and food is provided by you. They usually provide between 20-40hours of care each week.  Most Au Pairs are travelling students with english as their second language. They are often young and inexperienced, and working in Australia on temporary visas.  Ideally, your home will have a separate living area for the AuPair. This form of child care can be effective providing both the Aupair and the host family are clears about all aspects of caring for the children and the living arrangements. Communication breakdowns can easily occur if there is a huge language barrier. AuPairs do not tend to commit to long term agreements. \n\n\nBABYSITTER: A babysitter provides supervision of your children for short periods of time, mostly on a casual basis. Babysitters range from high school students through to fully qualified and experienced career nannies, which is reflective of their hourly rate. Babysitters are mostly called upon in the evenings when children are sleeping, hence why younger inexperienced carers can be used.\n\n\nProbably the largest factor influencing your choice of child care is costs. A sole charge nanny may be out of reach for many families,  but centre based care may come with inconvenience and hidden costs. Be careful to investigate all your options before deciding which form of care will best meet your family requirements.\n \nConsistency for your children is an important aspect to consider.\n', 'the-many-types-of-child-care-explained', '2014-11-30'),

Without honesty, comes a luck of trust. And trust, is the fundamental basis for a happy nanny share arrangement. A strong sense of trust must be formed between both families and the nanny. Families must be completely honest about their requirements and values. Even the smallest white lie can damage trust. Nannies must be open and honest about anything and everything in regards to the children in their care. Any issues should be discussed immediately from all parties to prevent unwanted escalations.\n\nConsistency: Its vital that consistency flows from the families, through the nanny and onto the children. Children raised with consistent guidelines  and limits grow into happy, well adjusted little people. Lack of consistency creates confusion and frustration so its important that everyone involved in the nanny share arrangement implements similar structures and values. For example, if the parents says no to something, the nanny needs to follow through with the same. Consistency with disciplinary methods is paramount.\n\nRespect: This is a 2-way street. In order to gain respect, one must also give it. A nanny is not just an employee, she(or he, if its a manny) is the person that you are trusting to care for your most precious possessions. And from a nanny''s perspective, the parents aren''t  just a boss. They become friends, and sometimes even like family. Everyone must respect each others values and beliefs, which should be thoroughly discussed in the interview process. Role modelling respect in the company of the children is a priceless life lesson for them to witness and learn.\n\nCommunication:It can''t be stressed enough how crucial it is that both families clearly communicate their needs with each other and their prospective nanny. Unfortunately it''s not uncommon for nannies or families to feel disgruntled when certain duties are not completed or certain ideas are overlooked or changed. This is easily avoided by  concise clarity about the expectations required of everyone involved. A contract which outlines duties,hours, wages and conditions, can easily avoid any such issues. A daily diary is a very simple yet effective method of communicating in addition to daily discussions.\n\nEmpathy: A simple but powerful emotion that can make or break any relationship. No two people are the same, and too often we expect others to think and act the same way as we do. However, thats not the case. Remember that your nanny has a life outside of work and respect that but sticking to the agreed hours and job description outlined in the contract. Always discuss flexibility with your prospective nanny around working extra hours. And nannies should remember that the parents are often juggling corporate stress and shouldn''t be judged on their choices. A qualified nanny can offer professional advice and tips relating to child development, but must exercise empathy to understand why families make certain choices about raising their children. A little empathy goes a long way.\n\n\nIMPLEMENT AND REMEMBER THESE FIVE SIMPLE PRINCIPLES AND YOUR NANNY-SHARE ARRANGEMENT IS GUARANTEED TO BE A HUGE SUCCESS!\n\n\nHAPPY FAMILIES\nHAPPY NANNY \nHAPPY CHILDREN', 'the-5-most-important-elements-for-a-successful-nanny-share', '2014-12-16'),
(12, 'How to choose the right family for a nanny share arrangement', '1b3b44b4d25bcc4640c3c94914919e36.jpg', 'How to find the perfect family match for a successful nanny share arrangement\n\nFinding the right family to share a nanny is the first step in a rewarding nanny share agreement. There  are several methods of locating like-minded families. You can advertise your search for a family on social media in the hope there is a family located close to you that is looking to share a nanny on the same days as you require. You can contact one of the many nanny share agencies Australia wide, whom will do the searching for you, however placement fees can be costly. Or, as of November 2014, you can login to nannyshareaustralia.com.au, create your family profile and search the database for families within your area whom may be suitable. Once you have found a family who you believe may be a good fit, its paramount that the interview is comprehensive in covering anything and everything which may effect a nanny share arrangement.  Organise an informal meeting of families, preferably  with the entire family on each side in attendance. If the care is to occur alternatively each week in both  homes, arrange a meeting in each to ensure you are happy with the safety of the other families home setup.    \n\nBelow is a list of questions that can be discussed to decide whether the match is suitable.\n\n\nHow old is your child?  Are you planning any more children in the near future?\nAre you looking for a long term commitment with the nanny share arrangement?\nAre you willing to share with a third family, hence splitting the cost three ways?\nDoes your child attend any scheduled weekly activities? e.g. Gymbaroo, swimming lesson, etc\nDoes your child have any food allergies? What are your views towards healthy eating?\nDoes your child have any special needs considerations?\nAre you prepared to supply a portacot and car seat for your child?\nWhat is your child''s daily routine and are you flexible around it?\nAre you comfortable with pets?\nAre you comfortable with a swimming pool in the backyard and happy for the nanny to take your child swimming there in the warmer months?\nDo you already have a nanny or shall we find one together?\nWhat type of nanny are you looking for? mature aged? Experience level?\nWould you prefer a nanny with her own ABN or are you happy to set up a PAYG system? In the event the nanny does not have an ABN, will you take care of tax and super obligations or will we split it down the middle?\nWhat days and hours of care do you require. Are you flexible with this? When do you need care to commence?\nDo you want the care to take place in my home, your home, or alternate each week?\nWould you prefer to pack your childs food each week or are you happy to supply it depending on which home the care occurs in?\nAre you planning on moving or renovating in the  near future?\nHow much are you prepared to pay the nanny? \nAre you comfortable with a nanny taking your child on outings in the car?\nDo you have a car the nanny can use or shall we agree on a split car allowance?\nDo you have any religious beliefs which may impact on the arrangement?\nAre you ok with my child still receiving care at your home when he/she is unwell?\nDo you have any planned holidays coming up?\nWhat are your views and techniques towards discipline?\nDo you allow your children to watch television and if yes, when, what and how long?\nWhat are your expectations towards duties required of the nanny? eg. cooking/washing/cleaning?\nWhat is the most important goal for you in having your child cared for by a nanny?\nIn the event that our nanny is unwell, are you in a position to find alternate care, or would you be interested in sharing the sick days between us. i.e. we take on the responsibility of care on a shared basis. \n\nThe more questions you ask in the interview process, the better understanding you will have of the other families needs, values and ideas. Try to remain  flexible and compromise a little if needed, whilst maintaining honesty and without compromising your own needs and limitations.   You don''t need to have identical views on everything but its important that you agree on the main logistics and beliefs.  Don''t be disheartened if it takes several interviews to find the perfect family match. Its best to feel 100% certain from the beginning to minimise future disruption and inconsistencies for everyone involved. Always go with your gut, if something doesn''t feel right, than more than likely it will create problems down the track. \n\nSo, you''ve found your family match....now its time to secure the best nanny for the role. The nest blog will explain the process in achieving this goal, with a suggested list of questions to ask in the nanny interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'how-to-choose-the-right-family-for-a-nanny-share-arrangement', '2014-12-18'),

Every book comes with its <strong>own sets of ideas</strong>, usually based on the values, experiences and research collated by the author. The New Basics is an easy go-to collection of alphabetically arranged addressing childhood issues ranging from discipline and diarrhoea through to nipple confusion and nosebleeds. The reason I love this book its due to its tried and tested success through my experience. My own personal values are on par with the no-nonsense methods of Michel Cohen, and through implementing many of his ideas Ive assisted families in raising their children to become healthy, happy and well-adjusted individuals. </span></p>\n\n<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:16px">Due to the Cyber-world in which we live today, we are inundated with information at the press of a finger. Same may say that books are becoming obsolete. However, I personally believe its important to obtain a small library of preferred books that we can access at any time. </span></p>\n\n<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:16px">Sometimes we need information, other times its inspiration or reassurance that we require. The world wide web has an overload of information, but finding an author whom you trust and respect is priceless.<strong> All children and their families are unique</strong>.

For example, if you prefer controlled crying as a sleep training method, ensure your book of choice follows similar principles. </span></p>\n\n<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:16px">*ideally, <strong>keep an open-mind</strong> before ruling out any methods before you completely understand them. There are no right and wrongs of parenting. <strong>Never feel that you have failed</strong> if your child doesn&#39;t live up to the text book stereotypes.

This is mostly a recipe for future problems. Having worked as a nanny for 2 decades, I have found myself in both contractual and non-contractual nanny agreements. The long term positions all had a contract in place. The short-term positions DID NOT have a contract in place. Oh, and when I say short term...that wasn&#39;t what they set out to be. All my positions were entered into with hope and expectation that they would be long term, because lets face it, no-one wants to be up heaved in their jobs every few months. But the non-contractual positions were short term, exactly because of that. Without a contract, there were unclear expectations from both sides as to my duties as a nanny and all monetary obligations involved. When issues arose, they were mostly a result of a misunderstanding and lack of clarity from the onset. Without a contract in place, there was nothing to fall back on. Ive met hundreds of nannies over the years, each with their own set of work issues that they&#39;ve had to deal with throughout their own work life as career nannies. Each and every problem that Ive heard, was the result of mis-communication and an absence of contractual clarity. To offer advise to such problems, Id often find myself asking &quot;what does it say in your contract?&quot;. If I had a dollar for every time the answer was &quot;I don&#39;t have a contract&quot;...Id be rich! </span></p>\n\n<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:14px">When you join the gym, you sign a contract.

The family becomes the employer...and the nanny becomes the employee......just like any other work agreement situation Some families may fear that a contract with tarnish the relationship that are are building with their nanny. In actual fact, it assists in creating the perfect understanding required from everyone involved in the relationship by outlining clear and concise ground rules. </span></p>\n\n<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:14px">Sample contracts can be found online or you may wish to draw one up yourself as a family.

In&nbsp;many nanny positions I have held, parents have asked &quot;why will my child eat vegetables for you and not for me?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:14px">I&#39;m not a child psychologist nor an expert in nutrition, but I&#39;m a career nanny of almost 20years and have carried out hundreds of thousand of toddler meal times during this time. Every child is unique, but simple principles can be applied to them all with success. <span style="color:#FF0000">Persistence and consistency is of fundamental</span> importance. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:14px">As with any aspect of raising healthy happy children, if you <span style="color:#FF0000">understand the &#39;why&#39;</span> behind the behaviour, then you&#39;re success in addressing it will be ten-fold! </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Why will my toddler only eat chips?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:14px">Umm, perhaps because they taste so much better than broccoli? Is it because they are too tired at the moment to try anything new? </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:14px">Are they feeling unwell and just the thought of steamed fish is turning their stomach. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:14px">Or is it simply because, the option of having chips for dinner is a choice that you have allowed. So how do you stop your toddler from consuming a hot-chip laden diet and replace it with healthy well-balanced meals? <span style="color:#FF0000">Healthy eating habits should</span> <span style="color:#FF0000">be introduced as young as possible.</span> The 3 main meals should ideally include some protein, starch and fruit and vegetables.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#0000FF"><strong>1 DON&#39;T INTRODUCE CHIPS IN THE FIRST PLACE</strong></span><strong>!</strong></span> If you already have, that&#39;s ok, just don&#39;t offer them again. If you&#39;re heading out for dinner and there&#39;s a strong possibility that the beloved chip will be present, fill them up on some vegetables beforehand and they&#39;ll be too full to consume these little strips of potatoes soaked in oil and smothered in salt.</p>\n\n<p><span style="color:#ff0099"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>2. ROLE MODEL</strong></span></span> healthy eating habits. Don&#39;t sit down and delight your own senses with pork crackling and hot chips, and expect your toddler to devour a plate of stemmed veggies. Toddlers do not understand the nutritional benefits of healthy food or the detrimental effects of &quot;sometimes&#39; foods, so discussing it with them is pointless. Only YOU can control how often they are given such choices.</p>\n\n<p><span style="color:#0000CD"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>3. TIME YOUR MEALS EFFECTIVELY</strong></span></span>, Keep a diary for a week about what your child eats when. If they tend to eat more in the morning, jam-pack breakfast with loads of goodness and focus less on the evening meal. Children tend to eat less when they are tired. Who says you can&#39;t have chicken pasta for breakfast and Weetbix for dinner?! Don&#39;t rush meal times. If your child is a slow eater, allow ample time for them to finish their meal. Patience is paramount. Provide light healthy snacks during meals but do not encourage grazing.</p>\n\n<p><span style="color:#ff0099"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>4. UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR CHILD MEANS.</strong></span></span> So your child says &quot;I don&#39;t like chicken risotto&quot;, even though they&#39;ve enjoyed it 300 times in the past! They may not have developed the language skills they need to express what they really mean. I &quot;don&#39;t like&quot; is often miss used by toddlers who want to say&quot;i don&#39;t feel like it&quot;. So don&#39;t give up on those recipes that they once loved, chances are, they will &quot;like it&quot; the next time they &quot;feel like it&quot;.</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong><span style="color:#0000FF">5. KEEP OFFERING SMALL AMOUNTS </span></strong></span>of new and different foods&nbsp;on the side of their plate, even if they say they don&#39;t like it. It may mean throwing out half a tomato everyday for a month, but eventually they will enjoy a variety of foods as their taste buds develop and change. Encourage them to try, but NEVER force them to eat anything. Accept that there will be foods that you may need to give up on, but give it a month, and try again a couple of weeks later. I&#39;m 41, and I still don&#39;t like mushrooms!!!</p>\n\n<p><span style="color:#ff0099"><strong><span style="font-size:16px">6. EXPOSE THEM TO A VARIETY OF FOODS.</span></strong></span> The proof is in the pudding here if you look at what children eat for breakfast around the world. I&#39;m sure I could count on one hand how many toddlers living in Japan eat Vegemite on toast to start the day, or Australian toddlers that choose sashimi as their breakfast of choice for that matter. Only in the past 10 years, Australian children are indulging in Sushi as their chosen take away.</p>\n\n<p><span style="color:#0000CD"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>7. DON&#39;T STRESS IF&nbsp;YOUR TODDLER EATS NOTHING AT A MEAL. </strong></span></span>Look at how much they&#39;ve eaten over the week. Their reason for not eating could include a lack of hunger, over tiredness, teething or sickness. We as adults know there are times when are appetites are low, unfortunately toddlers don&#39;t have the cognitive or language abilities to explain that. Trust me, eventually they will become hungry, and will welcome some steamed greens! Children can survive for a week without food, provided they are getting fluids. Its safe to say that the incidence of starvation in Australia is not an issue of concern. As soon as you see signs of a &#39;fussy eater&#39;.....letting them go a little hungry in the short term will benefit greatly in the long! Im not suggesting you starve your child, they WILL eat when they&#39;re hungry,</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong><span style="color:#ff0099">8. MAKE MEAL TIMES FUN.</span></strong></span> Sit down together as a family if you can. Limit distractions such as television. Its unnecessary to create games or tricks to encourage feeding, but it can be fun. Remember though, if you made a food face yesterday, your toddler may demand it again today and tomorrow, and the next day.......so be aware of possible consequences of your actions! If possible, involve toddlers in meal prep. Miss 2.5yrs usually consumes an entire serve of salad without even realising it when she is involved in cutting up some of the soft vegetables.</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong><span style="color:#0000CD">9. DON&#39;T BRIBE CHILDREN WITH TREATS.</span></strong></span> Do you have dessert every night?!! Children are not born gluttons...but daily dessert offerings can develop this. Treats on special occasions such as parties are an unavoidable part of life, don&#39;t even try to fight that one. And if you really can&#39;t resist from the dessert bribe. At least, make it a healthy treat like yoghurt, and NEVER EVER allow it if they haven&#39;t taken a considerable bite&nbsp;out of their dinner.</p>\n\n<p><span style="color:#ff0099"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>10.PROVIDE CHOICE</strong></span></span>. Children are egocentric. Making decisions helps them feel independent. So always give options at meal time, ensuring the options are appropriate. For example, &quot;would you like tomatoes or cucumbers with your dinner?&quot; Never give open ended choices such as &quot;what would you like for dinner?&quot;....as your answer may well be &quot;CHIPS&quot;!!!!</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>If you have followed all these basic fundamentals, yet meal times continue to be food-dodging episodes where peas are torpedoed across the floor and your childs lungs are reaching unimaginable decibels in stubborn refusal to eat.........this is how to handle it in four simple steps! </strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style="color:#000000">1.Stay calm. </span></p>\n\n<p>2.Explain to the child that meal time is over and the next meal time will be in 3-4 hours.</p>\n\n<p>3.Wipe down the child, wipe down the highchair, collect the sea of peas off the floorboards.</p>\n\n<p>4.DO NOT give any food until the next meal time. Keep repeating this strategy....children learn through repetition. Give in once, you&#39;ve given in a thousand times.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Healthy eating is an important issue to address when entering a nanny share agreement.

Many career nannies will tend to lower their hourly rate late at night when it is assumed that the children will be sleeping.

(138, 115, 57, 'Hi Simone,\n\nI''m looking for someone to share our nanny in Bronte. She works 5 days for us, looking after our 3 year and 18 month old boys. The 3 year old goes to preschool on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and we are looking for someone to share on some or all of those days.  We have a lovely Nanny called Kaitlin, who has been working for us since August 2014, and both boys adore her. She is friendly, polite, and wonderful with the boys, taking them out on regular excursions. She is great at following the routines I set for the younger one, let me know if things aren''t going to plan, and is always punctual. She left her job in a childcare centre to work for me, as she wanted a change from that environment, and her manager there was very unhappy to see her go. \n\nOur current hours are 8-6pm, and we would expect you to pay $15 per hour for the hours of care you needed, an even split of the $30 we currently pay her to look after two kids. Given the nature of the job, most parts are negotiable, ie days, start and finish times, and location. If this is along the lines of what you are looking for, I would love to hear from you!\n\nCheers,\n\nKim \n0411 444 442', 0),

Not an ideal situation if caring for children if I need to take time off to get him well! \nMummy nannying a better option.

Always great getting tips, best places to go with kiddies and recommendations  from the locals. \nWith all nanny share arrangements with a mummy nanny, it''s always negotiable.\nI''ve worked for many years as a nanny for families in the east and north shore. I have always been paid well based on my qualifications and experience. Mummy nannying is a lower rate due with the nannys child joining the arrangement.\nI have a delightful little boy (as they all are) who is now 19mths. \nAs much as it would be nice to have him make friends in a daycare environment, we all know those bugs lurk in childcare. Not an ideal situation if caring for children if I need to take time off to get him well! \nMummy nannying a better option. The family also gains for many reasons, but most importantly more one on one care in their own surroundings. \nI also do babysitting of a weekend should you be interested.\nMy number is 0402010274 should you wish to chat.\nThanks for contacting me\nMeredith'),

I stayed 4 fantastic years with the same family, caring for 2 young children. (One from birth) On returning home I spent many years working for NannySA and privately, caring for lovely, professional families across Adelaide. (Including Doctors, a Surgeon and Psychologist) I was employed in long-term positions with children from ages 3 - 8 months onwards. Parents have described me as being, “caring, flexible, creative, intuitive, respectful, calm, extremely reliable, irreplaceable, and with an obvious genuine love for children”.\n\nI’ve only just finished working for a wonderful family with one gorgeous girl – and I was her sole charge nanny from 11 weeks to now almost 5 years old. As she will be starting school full time next year, the family will no longer need my care. \n\nI’m also thrilled to have had so much interest on Gumtree/other sites, and I’ve just secured a lovely family for 2015! This role will be a long term permanent nanny position (Monday and Tuesday) with a baby boy.\n\nI will therefore be seeking another very special family to continue my nanny career, to start around February / March + onwards in 2015 and ultimately long term. Ideally, a family with a baby, parents returning to work and hoping for a loving nurturing nanny, to become a part of their family and share in all the milestones. (On a 2 or 3 day a week - long term basis)\n\n I''m a committed nanny who is focused on a loving and learning environment. I am dedicated to providing quality in home care. Although exceptionally organised and tidy, I''m not a housekeeper / cleaner, I''m a professional nanny and seeking a family who appreciates and respects a loyal and devoted nanny / early childhood educator. \n\nAlong with my extensive experience in early childhood, I’ve studied and trained privately with National Nannies and completed a Childcare course. Training included lectures, tutorials and practical with exams.\n\nAs a qualified professional nanny, I have newly completed essential certificates and documentation:\n \n*St. Johns Ambulance first aid training (specifically customised for care of children & infants) \n*National criminal history check, enabling me to work with children\n*(On request only) GP’s letter stating I''m healthy; mentally and physically capable to work with young children. (Non smoker) \n\nMost importantly, I have glowing long-term references. \n\nUltimately I''m looking for the perfect fit and willing to wait for just the right family. I work best with organised, easy going families that have a good sense of humour and are highly communicative. (These attributes best describe my character) \n\nSeeking in 2015:\n\n•	2 full days a week position – open to 1-3 days for the right family / start date negotiable\n•	Wednesday, Thursday and / or Friday permanent part time nanny position\n•	Care of 1  / 2 children (3 months – 10 month old baby, highly preferable) \n•	Family wanting long term - permanent care \n•	Sole charge care (parents work outside the home) \n•	Family residing near CBD or surrounding suburbs of Adelaide\n•	Warm welcoming family, who just want the best care for their precious baby\n\nIf I sound like I might be the right match for your family’s needs in 2015, please email me. I''d love to hear from you. \n\nKindly, \nProfessional Career Nanny - ENQUIRIES: \nnannycare@adam.com.au\n \n \n \n\n\n\n'),

Working in childcare centres for so many years, I have gained the experience of setting up specific art and craft activities which help develop new skills through different concepts of that specific activity, like water play,coloring, mixing colors...and many, many more...\nFrench, Italian( worked for Franco/Aussie families since 2006 on daily basis to current day.', 1, 'Dear Family,\nThank you very much for taking the time in reading my profile, an opportunity to introduce myself. My background education is in Biochemistry and I''m very passionate about latest research regarding health so I am leading a very healthy life. After the birth of my daughter, I''ve discovered how much joy, love, affection a child can bring into this life and how little it takes to make a child happy so I decided to follow a career into the Childcare Industry. I consider working with children a privilege and wouldn''t change a thing! My first paid childcare role was in 1997 offered by Deli Community Service/Department of Community Service. Later on, was asked to join the Kooloora Department of Community Service/Playgroup coordinator role.While working for the Department, was asked to join the Out of School Hours team and Vacation Care run by the Randwick City Council. After 2 years the service ceased due to unforeseen circumstances so worked in a Long Day Childcare Centre for 5 years. Was so passionate about my work so I''ve decided to take further steps in completing a level of education and enrolled at TAFE and completed the Children''s Services Certificate III, while having 2 jobs, one at the childcare centre and a second one at OLSH Primary School, Out of School Hours and Vacantion Care.\nMy first role as a nanny was in 2006. Since then had various roles,the longest employment dated in 2008 til current day, for a family of 3, full time, sole charge, for many years, now just a day/week help with after school care. I have long experience working for Franco/Aussie families. \nDue to my extensive experience( 18 years)and working with families and children of different background, I have the ability to connect very quickly and settle very easily to new routines. I am very organised and the children in my care very tidy, well mannered, good eaters,happy, challenged, stimulated, active! Good with toilet training! You can see how we''ve spent the day,in pictures,short videos, photo albums and folders/walls full of masterpieces:) I am in touch with the family throughout the day, like, when leaving, where we are going, when we''ve back. Many times went to the doctors, Children''s Hospital, dropped temperature,administrate medications! My references are outstanding, showing the love,care,passion,dedication and hard work towards the children and parents in offering genuine help, so when they return home from a long day at work , they can interact with their little ones for a bit before bed time, dinner is ready and the place neat and tidy!Committed, trustworthy, flexible, reliable, punctual, responsible with a big love for children and first of all, understanding and complying to their needs, providing a safe environment with lots of age related stimulation. Current First Aid/CPR,Police check/working with children clearance. Multitasking with an eye for detail,show self initiative,running errands, prepare meals,(my meals are cooked from scratch, healthy, nutritious, continental), housekeeping, extra curriculum activities like, dance, gymnastic, swimming,trips to local Library,Museums, Sea Life,Wild Life, Water Play,Playgoup. My activities are planned after a close observation of the child as every child develops different so by providing the right one will help the child achieve new skills in a confident, fun way'),

My goal is to allow them to explore the world and learn at their own pace. \nI believe children should be respected in their own right, allowed to express their emotions and in the importance of providing a safe place where they can be themselves.\nI have a 7 month old son and we would love to find a family to share our days with.\n'),
